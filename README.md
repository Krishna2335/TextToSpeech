# TextToSpeech

A collection of Python scripts for converting text into speech using various Text-to-Speech (TTS) engines. This project demonstrates different approaches to implement TTS functionalities in Python.

## Features

- Multiple Python scripts showcasing different TTS implementations.
- Utilizes various TTS libraries and APIs.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries (specified in each script).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishna2335/TextToSpeech.git
   cd TextToSpeech
   ```

2. Install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, please refer to individual scripts for their specific dependencies.*

## Usage

Each script in this repository demonstrates a different method to convert text to speech. Here's a brief overview:

- `Fast_DF_TTS.py`: [Brief description of what this script does.]
- `TTS_DF.py`: [Brief description of what this script does.]
- `TextToSpeech_Python.py`: [Brief description of what this script does.]
- `ttsB.py`: [Brief description of what this script does.]

*Note: Replace the bracketed sections with concise descriptions of each script's functionality.*

To run a script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the desired script's filename.
